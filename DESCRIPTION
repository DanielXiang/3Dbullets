Description: A package which contains methods for the leveling and rotation of
    3D images of bullet cartridges. The leveling process involves taking a linear
    regression over the i and j coordinates and producing a best fit plane, and
    then we adjust the depth values so that the best fit plane is a level plane. The
    rotation process involves multiplying coordinates by a rotation matrix, and then
    bilinearly interpolating the neighboring 4 points of the resulting non integer
    coordinates.
